# Outbound Material Result Hardening

## Meaning of This Phase

Hardens WMS Outbound result identity, versioning, idempotency, persistence, and Schema Registry compliance.

## Objective

Ensure MES material-staging requests produce deterministic Staged or Shortage results that can be safely consumed and reconciled.

## Scope

- request inbox validation
- logical request idempotency
- staged result payload
- shortage result payload
- correlation and causation
- result event version
- outbox durability
- Schema Registry registration
- duplicate request behavior

## Required Inputs

- WMS Integration Support `GLOBAL_RULE.md`
- MES–WMS Integration Contract Pack
- Integration Validation Pack
- Existing WMS architecture and enterprise WMS documentation
- Current MES and PDA integration reports relevant to this phase

## Architecture Constraints

- Work only inside WMS unless this phase is explicitly verification-only.
- Do not modify MES.
- Do not redesign WMS architecture.
- Preserve database-per-service ownership.
- Preserve verified Kafka transport.
- Do not add shared Redis or cross-database access.
- Do not implement deferred domains.

## Required Deliverables

- implementation or verification artifacts required by this phase;
- updated tests;
- migration files where required;
- runtime evidence;
- phase completion report;
- updated blocker and readiness status.

## Verification Requirements

Use all applicable levels:

- unit tests;
- contract tests;
- database integration;
- migration rehearsal;
- API behavior;
- Kafka integration;
- idempotency;
- concurrency;
- failure recovery;
- clean-data full flow;
- migrated-data full flow;
- MES/PDA joint verification where applicable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] duplicate MES request does not create duplicate transfer
- [ ] same logical request returns the same authoritative result
- [ ] result events include approved identity and quantities
- [ ] outbox recovery is runtime verified

## Stop Conditions

Stop and report when:

- a shared contract is unresolved;
- ownership would change;
- direct MES database access is required;
- an incompatible event change is required;
- a fixture requires unsafe production SQL;
- a major architecture conflict is discovered.

## Required Final Status

Use one:

```text
PASS
PARTIAL
BLOCKED_BY_CONTRACT
BLOCKED_BY_ENVIRONMENT
BLOCKED_BY_ARCHITECTURE
```
